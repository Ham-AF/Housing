# Ames Housing dataset eda and modeling by Hammaad Afzal
    I was tasked with looking through and trying to make a model that predicted the Ames Houseing Prices of the data sheet, though more could be done.
    This was done as project 2 for DSI bootcamp by GA.
    
# Code

    Two ipynb files can be found named EDA and Modeling, through self explanatory id like to go into my mindset. I decided to just use two files as it would make flipping back and forth and checking where errors would be coming from easier. The EDA file mostly consists of me making the the data clean enough to model, as when that was accomplished i moved on. I proceeded to model the data using various regression models like Lasso, Linear Regression, Ridge, and ElasticNet, then i cross validated the scores and found the mean squared error. As the score isnt that great, for myself i suggest removing more columns and making more features, also i think going backwards and slowly adding back on features instead of shaving them off would lead to a better score, but id have to find out.
